        <h1>About Kyle</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Kyle and this is my website! I'm 25 years old and a college dropout! While I was in school
           I studied Computer Science. After working a retail job that I hate for about 3 years now, I've decided to
           dip my toes back into the world of programming to try and make a better life for myself!</p>
        <p>My two biggest hobbies are video games and music! RPG's have to be my favorite genre of video games but I
           enjoy many different types. My music tastes are widely varied but the three cornerstones have to be Hardcore,
           K-Pop, and Rap. Aside from learning all this stuff about web development, I'm also making a video game as a 
           side project! It's a lot of work to make a video game, especially solo, so it probably won't be done for 
           a long while.</p>
