        <h3>10/12/23 - Lots of Stuff!</h3>
        <p>Today is a day about <strong>lists</strong> and <strong>links!</strong>'re learning a little bit about both 
           ordered and unordered lists so we can make things like to-do lists or grocery lists. 
           For example, we could make a list where it doesn't matter what order it's in, such as a grocery list.
           <ul>
                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
           </ul>
           Easy right? What if I wanted to make a to-do list where things need to be done before others?
           <ol>
                <li>Cook Dinner</li>
                <li>Wash Dishes</li>
                <li>Do Laundry</li>
           </ol>
           Boom! You can't exactly wash dirty dishes if there are none can you? Next on the menu are links and images!
           <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a link!</a> 
           Takes you right to The Odin Project "about" page in a new tab doesn't it? That one was an absolute link since
           I used the full domain name. How about a <a href="./pages/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> 
           to the about page on <em>this</em> website. Pretty cool huh? You get to know a little bit about me!
           This time I used a relative link since I didn't have to provide a full domain name to get to it. Next up is an image!</p>

           <p>Look at that pupper! What a good boy.</p>

        <h3>10/11/23 - The First</h3>
        <p>This is the beginning of a <strong>brighter</strong> future!</p>
        <p>Today we're learning how to create an html boilerplate and getting an introduction to a few of the basic tags 
           such as the different headers, paragraphs, and <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italics</em>. 
           We're also getting a glimpse into comments! Unfortunately you can't see those unless you read the raw
           html file.</p>
